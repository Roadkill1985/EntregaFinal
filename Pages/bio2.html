                        NUESTRO OCULTO SENTIDO (N.O.S.) was born in mid-2013, with a musical proposal aimed at the metal genre,
                        but without being pigeonholed in any branch due to the versatility of its sound. As time went by, the band started
                        to work on the composition of his own melodies that later led to a DEMO that included five songs from his
                        authorship and recorded in Double B rooms, which was released at the end of 2014.
                                        
                        During that year the band appeared with references of the genre such as Horcas, Plan 4, among others. Besides counting
                        with the pride of representing Córdoba at the Metal Para Todos Festival in its seventh (2014) and eighth (2015) editions,
                        invited by the producer of said event and sharing the stage with the greatest exponents of the country.
                        As of 2016, N.O.S. takes a remarkable leap in terms of the imprint they want to show with their image and demonstrate
                        an important adjustment in terms of sound. To demonstrate this new way of working, the group releases an EP with three songs
                        previews of the new material, exclusively for the press. This work was recorded and mastered at Av Estudio,
                        in charge of Matías Takaya who served as Musical Producer.

                    <div class="col">It should be noted that from said advance material, a lyric video of the song “El Experimento” emerged based on the
                        Russian dream experiment of the 40's, the same one carried out in Nur Studies.
                                                
                        As of 2017 the band achieves important presentations with musicians from the local, national, and international scene,
                        arriving to share the stage with Night Demon (USA) and Kataklysm (Canada), among others.
                        As the year progressed, the production of the debut album was finished, which was officially presented in Vorterix Córdoba,
                        it was called AWAKENING and is available in physical format, in addition to all digital platforms.
                                                
                        In 2018 the group announced on their official social networks two line-up changes in the band that featured Nath Bloother
                        as the group's new vocalist, and Mauro Muñoz on Guitar, who came to N.O.S. to give it a new image and strengthen the message that the band tries to convey.                      
                        After having shared the stage with Vader, the band performs the official presentation of Despertares in Córdoba Capital.
                        Date after which, he decided to take a break and restructure himself, incorporating Marcelo Muñoz on guitars and Jose Salas on voices into his ranks, a formation that was announced in July 2019 and with which they participated on various dates, closing their cycle with John Prasec (England) in the Argentina Master And Demons Tour carried out in different parts of Argentina. After the departure of Marcelo Muñoz, Adam Milde is incorporated, who takes his place as guitarist.
                        After performing at some local recitals, and for personal reasons, Mauro Muñoz left the band, to make way for Maxi Gamkosian, who joined the band to give it a more aggressive mark.
